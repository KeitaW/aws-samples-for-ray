# End-to-End Machine Learning using ray

This workshop goes through a common customer journey when beginning and maturing their MLOps journey from Initial to Scalable.

This workshop will introduce the use of [Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/getting-started.html) on Sagemaker. Ray is an open-source distributed computing framework designed to accelerate and simplify the development of scalable and efficient machine learning applications. It provides a simple and flexible API for defining and executing [tasks](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/tasks.html) and [actors](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/actors.html) on a cluster of machines, allowing you to easily scale your machine learning workloads from a single machine to thousands of nodes.

Ray is designed to [support a wide range of machine learning libraries and frameworks](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/train/getting-started.html), including popular tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. It also includes built-in support for distributed reinforcement learning, hyperparameter tuning, and model serving, making it easy to build end-to-end machine learning pipelines.

One of the key features of Ray is its ability to handle both task parallelism and actor-based concurrency, allowing you to easily express complex computation patterns and data dependencies. Ray also provides efficient scheduling and data sharing mechanisms, enabling fast and scalable execution of machine learning workloads.

Ray is widely used in both industry and academia, and has a large and active community of contributors and users. Whether youâ€™re building a large-scale machine learning system or just getting started with distributed computing, Ray provides a powerful and easy-to-use platform for building and running your machine learning applications.
