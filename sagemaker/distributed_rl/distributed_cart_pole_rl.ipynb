    "# Distributed RL Training Using Ray Framework with Cart Pole v1 Environment"

    "In this SageMaker Notebook we will walkthrough an example using the Cart Pole v1 Reinforcement Learning (RL) use case. This is a classic RL use case where the environment is created within the [OpenAI gym toolkit](https://github.com/openai/gym). You can read more about the Cart Pole use case and refer to the initial research paper by Barto, Sutton, and Anderson in the following [Gym Documentation](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Ray framework is able to load the Cart Pole v1 environment using available algorithms from the Ray Reinforcement Learning library known as [RLlib](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib/index.html). You can find available RLlib algorithms [here](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib/rllib-algorithms.html). These algorithms have the ability to load the Cart Pole v1 environment with default configurations. This gives the user the ability to adapt original RL use cases to state of the art RL algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we use the [PPO](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib/rllib-algorithms.html#ppo) policy gradient based algorithm within Ray's RLlib library to load the Cart Pole v1 environment and run 10 iterations to train a RL model within a SageMaker Training Job. Later we adapt this example to a SageMaker Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) Tuning job to demonstrate tuning hyperparameters given a RL use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, to enable you to use Ray RLlib at scale we show how to extend a SageMaker Deep Learning Container (DLC), with the TensorFlow framework, with Ray to execute an Amazon SageMaker Training Job using a cluster of EC2 instances to distribute wworker tasks among your CPUs and reduce training time (both for CPU or GPU instance types). \n",
    "\n",
    "The key goals from this demonstration are:\n",
    "* Demonstrate how to extend a SageMaker DLC with Ray to power your RL use case and to use for both SM Training and HPO jobs\n",
    "* Provide a *Getting Started* example leveraging the RLlib library which you can adapt to your own use case\n",
    "* Show how to use Ray's tune class to output a report of key RL metrics among each training iteration in CloudWatch Logs"

    "    * This is a helper script that will help SageMaker initiate Ray amongst the EC2 instance(s). This will enable the Training Job to distribute the Ray tasks across the workers of the Ray cluster. You will call classes from this script in your entrypoint script. \n",
    "3. __train_cart_pole.py__ \n",
    "    * This is the entrypoint script for the RL training job. It will call __sagemaker_ray_helper.py__ to initiate the Ray cluster, import Ray python classes, load the Cart Pole environment, kick-off training iterations, and use Ray's tune class to report RL metrics each training iteration. "
